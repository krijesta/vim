My Vim Settings

  Clone the repository to ~/.vim then create a ~/.vimrc with the following
  contents.

    source ~/.vim/vimrc

  Alternatively on machines that support symlinks (not Windows) create a
  symlink in your home directory called ~/.vimrc pointing to ~/.vim/vimrc
  with the command:

    $ ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

  as this allows editing the file in with vim ~/.vimrc

If you are using a gui for vim then you will also want to create the 
same file/symlink for .gvimrc
